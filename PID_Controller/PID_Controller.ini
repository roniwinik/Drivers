# Define quantities in sections. This list is a selection of allowed keywords,
# see the manual for a full list of options
#   datatype:      The datatype should be one of DOUBLE, BOOLEAN, COMBO,
#                  STRING, COMPLEX, VECTOR, VECTOR_COMPLEX, PATH or BUTTON.
#   unit:          Quantity unit
#   set_cmd:       Command used to send data to the instrument. Put <*> where the value should appear.
#   get_cmd:       Command used to get the data from the instrument. Default is set_cmd?
#   def_value:     Default value
#   low_lim:       Lowest allowable value.  Defaults to -INF
#   high_lim:      Highest allowable values.  Defaults to +INF
#   combo_def_1:   First option in a pull-down combo box. Only used when datatype=COMBO
#   combo_def_2:   Second option in a pull-down combo box. Only used when datatype=COMBO
#   ...
#   combo_def_n:   nth option in a pull-down combo box. Only used when datatype=COMBO
#   state_quant:   Quantity that determines this control's visibility
#   state_value_1: Value of "state_quant" for which the control is visible
#   state_value_2: Value of "state_quant" for which the control is visible
#   ...
#   state_value_n: Value of "state_quant" for which the control is visible
#   permission:    Sets read/writability, options are BOTH, READ, WRITE or NONE. Default is BOTH 
#   group:         Name of the group where the control belongs.
#   section:       Name of the section where the control belongs.



[Setpoint]
datatype: DOUBLE
group: Parameters
tooltip: The setpoint that the PID will try to achieve

[P]
datatype: DOUBLE
def_value: 1.0
group: Parameters
tooltip: The value for the proportional gain Kp

[I]
datatype: DOUBLE
def_value: 0.2
group: Parameters
tooltip: The value for the integral gain Ki

[D]
datatype: DOUBLE
def_value: 0
group: Parameters
tooltip: The value for the derivative gain Kd

[Proportional on input]
datatype: BOOLEAN
group: Parameters
def_value: False
tooltip: Whether the proportional term should be calculated on the input directly rather than on the error (which is the traditional way). Using proportional on input avoids overshoot for some types of systems.

[Output limit - low]
datatype: DOUBLE
def_value: -INF
group: Limits

[Output limit - high]
datatype: DOUBLE
def_value: INF
group: Limits
